Python assignment using Tkinter and Matplotlib

Python assignment from HBO-ICT (Software Engineering), course Database Querying at THUAS (The Hague University of Applied Sciences).

The Python assignment is a part of a larger assignment, based on a SQL Server database of a fictional company renting and selling games and consoles.

The program should:
- import one or more datasets in a csv-format (exports from the SQL database)
- give the user a choice to select a report
- present the user a Matplotlib diagram per report, based on the imported dataset(s)
- give textual information about the diagrams

Added extra functionality:
- extra formatting, e.g. use of colormaps 
- radio buttons for showing the data alternatively in numbers and percentages
